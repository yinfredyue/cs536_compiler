It seems hard to add JLex to the path in WSL correctly. In the end, I just keep JLex in
a directory and moves the directory around. This is ok as we are only going to
use JLex for P2.

Steps:
1. Make a directory called "JLex/"
2. Go to JLex/, download Main.java
3. Compile Main.java with "javac Main.java", and get classes like "Main.class"
4. Exit JLex/, run JLex with a sample specification file sample.lex with
    java JLex.Main sample.lex
   You should get sample.lex.java

If you use if in windows terminal, move JLex/ to C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.6\bin\JLex and
ensure it is in CLASSPATH. Then you can use "javac JLex.Main" anywhere.

# Usage
java JLex.Main xxx.lex => xxx.jlex.java
javac xxx.jlex.java => Yylex.class
javac P2.java => P2.class
java Yylex P2
